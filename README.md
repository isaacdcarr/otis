# otis
> A computer-aided diagnosis system built by Isaac Carr working towards a thesis in the School of Mechanical & Manufacturing Engineering at UNSW

## Background
* This AI that is a part of a larger group thesis that aims to build a wearable health technology that can diagnose the number one health issue in the developing world 
* Pneumonia was selected as the number one health issue in the developing world. In a 2016 study by the World Health Organisation, it was identified that pneumonia was the fourth largest cause of death in the world and the largest cause of death amongst developing nations

## Otis
* The aim of `otis` is to assist medical professionals in diagnosing pneumonia
* It is a 2D convolutional neural network
* It is build using `Python`, predominantly `keras`
* `otis` uses >30,000 chest-xrays to provide a diagnosis to 
* In the future, an AI would be build using heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, breath indrawing, cyanosis as a opposed to chest x-rays as this data is more readily available in developing nations
